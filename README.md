Introduction - COVID related remote-work model problems

“Hybrid models of remote work are likely to persist in the wake of the pandemic, mostly for a highly educated, well-paid minority of the workforce.” --- McKinsey.com

How about the rest of the workforce? Due to the pandemic, it has become very clear that the interfaces of physical offices and remote work systems are very far apart. 


Challenge: Filling the physical and virtual office gap (from both Business Owners’ POV and Organlizations’ POV)

Initial solution (Business Owners’ POV = Narrower View): Create an Online Virtual Office with an integrated Clock-in system.
Virtual reality and web technologies provide exceptional opportunities for solving this global workforce problem. Utilizing the virtual office interface, employers can physically see the presence of the teams plus directly interact with them anytime, just as they used to. 

Ideal Solution (Organlizations’ POV = Broader View): ZOffice Web Application
In the virtual space, we aimed to enhance user experiences by integrating human-to-human interactions into the virtual office interface, allowing employers to physically see the presence of the team while employees can directly collaborate with their co-workers in one place, just as they used to. 


Result:
ZOffice is a fully functional web application equipped with features such as real-time image capture for employee performance tracking, public chatroom, and team building. A promotional video is also created. 

Due to budget and time constraints, file sharing, video conference functions, and final deployment are postponed.
